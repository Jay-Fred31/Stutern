                Gnetaceae commonly grown in West Africa, majorly in the southern and eastern parts of Nigeria.</p>
            <p>This greenish climbing plant is also prevalent in other tropical regions like Congo, Gabon, Angola, Asia and
                South America.
                In Eastern parts of Nigeria it is called Ukazi while the Southerners refer to it as Afang leave, it is used to
                make the popular
                cerimonial food "Afang soup" served at weedings and other functions. It is majorly a party food.
